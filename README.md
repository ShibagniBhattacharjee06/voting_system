Voting System on Aptos Blockchain
Introduction
This project implements a decentralized voting system on the Aptos blockchain. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures transparency, security, and immutability of votes, allowing participants to cast their votes with confidence that the process is fair and tamper-proof.

Features
Secure Voting: Each vote is securely recorded on the Aptos blockchain, preventing any unauthorized modifications.
Transparency: The voting results are publicly accessible, ensuring the integrity of the election process.
Decentralized: The system operates without a central authority, reducing the risk of fraud or manipulation.
Privacy: Voter identities are anonymized, ensuring privacy while maintaining the integrity of the vote.
Prerequisites
Aptos Wallet and APT tokens
Aptos CLI or SDK
Node.js (for setting up a server or frontend)
Basic understanding of blockchain and smart contracts




How It Works
Create a Poll: The administrator (or any authorized user) can create a new poll by specifying the options and the voting period.

Vote: Users can cast their vote by interacting with the smart contract via a frontend interface or directly using Aptos CLI.

Counting Votes: Once the voting period ends, the smart contract automatically tallies the votes.

Results: The results are published on the blockchain, where they can be viewed by anyone.

Smart Contract Overview
Vote: A function to record a user's vote.
CreatePoll: A function to initialize a new voting poll.
EndPoll: A function that ends the voting process and publishes the results.
GetResults: A function to retrieve the voting results for a specific poll.
